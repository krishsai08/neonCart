# NeonCart

NeonCart is a modern e-commerce web application built using **Next.js (App Router)** and **Supabase**.
It implements a complete shopping flow including product browsing, cart management, checkout, and order history.

This project focuses on real-world patterns such as authentication, Row Level Security (RLS), and clean state management.
